ToDo:
-USE XML to store the scaling data for the map (the original map pixels for instance and the sizes for various devices)


(1) Please merge your work from the branch into the master so I can work on an update version to test your static menu and review your other work
(2) Please setup the save-game functionality (manager class). Ideally, the game is saved automatically just like in Desert Fox without the user ever having to actually save the game. <Pls test to make identical to Desert Fox functionality!>
(3) Game Center. Related to #2 above is to setup the game-center functionality identical to the Desert Fox functionality. There should also be the auto-load feature that desert fox has. For instance, when you open the app, it automatically loads the game so you don't have to click on anything.
(4) UI testing. I'd like to setup UI testing but I am struggling a bit with it. I'd like to use it as I need to start testing my game logic more rigorously. Please setup a very simple UI test that I can then use as a template for testing.
