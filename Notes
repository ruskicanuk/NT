ToDo:
-USE XML to store the scaling data for the map (the original map pixels for instance and the sizes for various devices)






Thanks Dipen, that sounds like a good way to proceed. When you get a chance, can you see if its possible to do these things:

(1) Make sure spacing on your menuView file is not fixed (eg. currently = 100) and instead is calculated and positioned based on the screen size.

(2) Pls make How to play a split view controller with table on the left and content on the right just like in DF

(3) Are you able to remove the menuView.xib file? I noticed it references cocoa - I'd like to do everything in this app internal to swift without using html or cocoa if possible.

(4) In a similar way, is it possible to remove the storyboard file? Again, hoping to do everything programatically.

Note that if you think any of these are bad ideas, please tell me and don't do them :-) Thanks
